We use a nationally-representative survey (the labor supplement of the Survey of
Consumer Expectations) to study individuals’ behavioral biases in learning about their
wage distributions. Using a recently-developed test for Bayesianism (Augenblick and
Rabin, 2021), we find strong evidence of non-Bayesian learning. Specifically, among
individuals who receive wage offers, we find an average movement in beliefs that is
roughly 543% of the reduction in their beliefs’ uncertainty, a result consistent with
base-rate neglect and/or overreaction to signals. We further examine the heterogeneity
in agents’ learning by identifying specific non-Bayesian (and other) patterns, finding
additional individual patterns that could be explained by Gambler’s Fallacy and opti-
mistic reasoning
