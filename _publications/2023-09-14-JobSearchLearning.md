We use a nationally representative survey (the labor supplement of the Survey of
Consumer Expectations) to study individuals’ behavioral biases in learning about their
wage distributions. Using a recently developed test for Bayesianism (Augenblick and
Rabin, 2021), we find strong evidence of non-Bayesian learning. Specifically, among
respondents who receive wage offers, we find an average movement in beliefs that
is roughly 543% of the reduction in their beliefs’ uncertainty, 443% more than the
Bayesian benchmark, a result consistent with base-rate neglect and/or overreaction to
signals. This estimate remains large and significant when examining subsets of the
data separated by different labor market and demographic variables.
We further examine the heterogeneity in agents’ learning by identifying specific non-Bayesian patterns
that can be explained by multiple priors models and updating rules that accommodate motivated beliefs.
