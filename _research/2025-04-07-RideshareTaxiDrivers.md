<!---Abstract Here--->

Are legal rules requiring minimum benefits for gig workers effective in improving gig worker welfare? If independent contractor wages increase,
how does their labor supply respond? To study these questions, I explore the effects of a recently enacted state-wide legislation in Washington
mandating minimum transportation network company driver pay rates and paid sick leave on counties that did not previously have similar legislation.
Using administrative tax data, I study the effects on self-employed workers in the taxi and limousine services industry (which includes both taxi and
transportation network company drivers). Relative to my constructed synthetic controls, I estimate that the law increased average earnings by
about $1,191 and decreased the number of workers by about 8 per 100,000 residents during the first year it was effective. However, these differences
do not remain statistically significant under placebo testing. Additional descriptive analysis using household survey data suggests that the new
legislation might have allowed those driving as a primary occupation to earn higher effective hourly wages, leading to similar yearly earnings with
fewer hours of work.
