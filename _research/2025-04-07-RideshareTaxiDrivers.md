<!---Abstract Here--->

Are legal rules requiring minimum benefits for gig workers effective in
improving gig worker welfare? If independent contractor wages increase,
how does their labor supply respond? To study these questions, I explore
the effects of a recently enacted state-wide legislation in Washington mandating minimum transportation network company driver pay rates and
paid sick leave on counties that did not previously have similar legislation.
Relative to my constructed synthetic controls, I estimate that the law increased average nonemployer establishment earnings by about $1,191 and
decreased the number of establishments by about 8 per 100,000 residents
during the first year it was effective. These differences are associated with
p-values of 0.08 and 0.21, respectively, under placebo testing. Additional
descriptive analysis using household survey data suggests that the new
legislation might have allowed those driving as a primary occupation to
earn higher effective hourly wages, leading to similar yearly earnings with
fewer hours of work.
