<!---How does pay transparency in job postings affect worker outcomes?
We leverage several recent laws passed in the United States requiring employers
to list the expected wages in job listings to study to this question.
Using a staggered difference-in-differences approach, we find a significant decrease
in the unemployment rate in states adopting this policy. We
do not find significant effects on the transition rates of employed workers
or on new worker wages. Therefore, we hypothesize that the addition of
this information reduces frictional unemployment by reducing information costs and
ambiguity during job search, but does not significantly impact bargaining outcomes.--->
