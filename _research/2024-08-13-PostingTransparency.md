Does giving workers more information on wages help eliminate wage differentials?
We leverage a recent law passed in Colorado requiring employers to list the expected wages in job listings to study this question.
Using a synthetic control approach and administrative data on worker earnings, we find no causal evidence of a reduction in the gender gap in monthly earnings of newly hired workers in Colorado.
We conduct additional correlational analysis on potential mechanisms through which the law could have impacted the gender pay gap
(directed search, bargaining, and signal informativeness). Overall, our correlational evidence is consistent with male workers taking more
advantage of the increased transparency in postings than female workers, which could have had an attenuating effect on the policy's capacity
to reduce the gender gap. Our paper highlights the importance of ensuring information policy is properly targeted to its intended beneficiaries.
