Does increasing wage transparency effectively reduce pay disparities? We
address this question by examining the impact of Colorado’s Equal Pay for
Equal Work Act, a pioneering statewide policy mandating that employers
disclose salary ranges in all job postings. Employing a synthetic control
method to compare Colorado’s experience with a carefully constructed
counterfactual, we find no evidence that the law narrowed the gender
earnings gap among newly hired workers. In fact, our estimates indicate
a widening of approximately 15 percent, a statistically significant increase
relative to the synthetic control. We perform additional correlational
industry-level analysis, finding suggestive patterns consistent with gender
differences in search or bargaining behavior. Our results highlight critical
challenges in designing transparency policies and emphasize the necessity
of ensuring that information interventions align closely with the behavioral
responses of the intended beneficiaries.
