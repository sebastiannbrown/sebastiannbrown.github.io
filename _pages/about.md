Hello! I'm a PhD candidate in economics finishing my last year at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I primarily do applied work in labor economics using techniques and theory from microeconomics and behavioral economics. My research agenda focuses on the role of information and learning in the labor market. I am currently working on projects studying behavioral job search and the effect of recent pay transparency legislation on worker and firm outcomes.
<br /> <br />
Additionally, I care deeply about undergraduate student success as an educator. My teaching philosophy centers on creating interactive learning experiences that help students build intuition and confidence with challenging concepts. I also emphasize giving students chances to articulate their understanding of material to ensure they can apply what they learn outside the classroom.
<br /> <br />
I will be on the 2024-2025 job market. The most recent draft of my job market paper can be found under the "Research" tab at the top of this page.

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
